## Description :
    
This is an application for a manager to be able to answer prompts about their employees (engineers and interns), and have a web pages generated that display the team as a whole, or individual groups with details on each employee shown. 
Although this app is able to get through the prompts and properly push the user's input into an array based on the class/constructors created, there are still a few details to work out before this app is fully operational.
